 
Great information on initial cleanup of Inkscape SVG and adding classes, removing styles, etc.:
    - https://toughpixels.com/tips/clean-up-inkscape-svg-for-web/
    - https://svgontheweb.com/

For Hugo specifically, the two key points are:
    - Store all the necessary SVGs inside the /assets/images folder.
    - Embed the SVGs in the templates using a partial, say svg.html.

If you see a 'scour' error when saving an optimized SVG, installing scour will not solve the issue. The solution is to apt remove inkscape and then install from PPA:

sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install inkscape

As explained in the post at https://beamtic.com/inkscape-scour-bug
