I remember hearing an old trick to exercise willpower. People who were finding it difficult to begin, say, a new diet, were asked to do something extremely effortless and also arbitrary, even silly, at a certain time each day. The classic example I remember is putting a sock over a lampshade. The silliness of the exercise was by design.

The exercise could be surprisingly effective and illustrates both the power and the fragility of the will to act. 

We think that we act because of motivations, we want something, something will benefit us, or perhaps for a greater principle, something is logical, or right. But these are just part of the context in which the decision to act is made. As the exercise above points out, ultimately, we simply act because we decide to act, which is quite distinct from our motivations. 

We never ask why we even need willpower after all. At the border between the areas of motivation and action there is a resistance to act despite wanting something, despite it being advantageous, despite it being logical, etc. 

Actions have consequences, and some will involve risk. Acting involves incurring a debt of responsibility. Acting is inherently dangerous, and so we often default to remain acted upon. Acting in the face of this resistance is what makes us effective. It also explains why the correct decision in many contexts, particularly those with a significant moral element, is often the hardest to choose. Doing the right thing is an act of courage. 

Willpower is a potential tool, but there are many others. Ultimately the goal of all of these tools is the same: to focus our mental effort so we can act effectively. Tools often do this by imposing constraints, and structuring time is a clear example. 

Consider how an objective structure, even if arbitrary, supports focused effort. Once a structure is chosen, it is the default set of constraints in that area. To go against the structure either involves some degree of objective failure in your efforts, or you have consciously decided to act against it. This conscious decision to act carries its own very clear risks. So, the structure does not rely on willpower to be effective and it uses resistance to its advantage.
