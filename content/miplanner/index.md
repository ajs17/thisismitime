The subdivisions of mitime lend themselves to planning tools, such as this simple Standard Mitime daily planner: 

{{< miplanner >}}

This clearly shows how the day can be organized according to goals and priorities, with the mi representing larger scoped areas, such as a project, a complex task, an area of your life, and the mihours being smaller milestones, subtasks, etc. Because all units are equal, they are easily interchangeable and can be easily rearranged as needed.

Immediate implications are that knowing the mitime doesn't tell you the time of day so much as it tells you where you are in your day, how well you are progressing against your goals, and how much time remains. 

While this is useful for task planning, it perhaps excels even more at planning the structure of your day. Mitime focuses on how you spend your time, so it can support your efforts to more effectively organize your time, to adopt new habits, or break bad ones. 

Miclock, such as the real-time version on the home page, is a quick visualization of mitime in the form of a traditional analog clock. It matches our expectation of a clock that moves clock-wise, but remember that mitime *counts down:*
